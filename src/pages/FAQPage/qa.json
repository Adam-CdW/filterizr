  "caveats": [
    {
      "question": "Margin don't work for me?",
      "answer": "Bear in mind that Filterizr has no notion of margins. If you wish to create whitespace I suggest using a wrapper element and set padding on it, both for your items and your container. The width of your items will have to sum up to 100% per row."
    },
    {
      "question": "The CSS for my filtering has bad performance",
      "answer": "If the performance of your Filterizr's effect is not silky smooth, please make sure to read on <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/stick-to-compositor-only-properties-and-manage-layer-count\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">compositor-only properties</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/play-with-hardware-accelerated-css/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hardware-accelerated CSS</a> and go through your code again."
