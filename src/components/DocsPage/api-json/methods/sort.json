If its value is set to `'sortData'`, the elements are sorted based on the value of the user-defined `data-sort` attribute. Other possible values includes `'w'` or `'h'` if you wish to sort your elements by width or height (used for layouts of items of different size). To use a custom data-attribute for sorting you can to pass its name omitting the `data-` part. For example if you have defined a `data-author` HTML attribute on your grid items, you could invoke `filterizr.sort('author', 'asc');`."
